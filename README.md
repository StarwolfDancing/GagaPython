# GagaPython
Fun project for regular people;o) i.e. people without programming, computer science or engineering background. [Gaga](https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/gaga_nicht_recht_bei_Verstand) means for me nicely crazy, fun ...

## Spoiler
Since this is a fun project, I will add stuff irregularly.

## Introduction
To learn something new, I like to start with a personal topic and learn the necessary tool on my way. You find a cool example in chapter 1 of [Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2002.html) by ``Allen B. Downey``.

To dig into specific programming topic, e.g. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), I create small files, e.g. ``OnMarkdown.md``, to familiarise myself with the topic. 

## Initial Hurdle
To minimise the initial hurdle, the starting point for me is the Jupyter branch of [Project Jupyter | Try Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try) and [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
